# 2020 wasn't that bad, was it?

Having been bombarded with negative hedlines and tragic stories in media, I decided to look for silver linings and focus on uplifting news from around the world. I also wanted to make it a little bit more personal and for that reason I included a section with 'the bests of' from my year.

This project is for HTML & CSS practice (no JavaScript). The page is fully responsive. To make it stand out a bit, except from vivid colours, I used:

  - Parallax effect
  - CSS Timeline
  - A gallery with hover effect
  - Google Fonts
  - Font Awesome

All the collages I made myself in Canva.
